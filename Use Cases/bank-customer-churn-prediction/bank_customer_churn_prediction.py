  # Using Shapelets to prevent bank customer churn

  ## 1. Introduction
In this study, we aim to accomplish the following tasks:

- Identify and visualize factors contributing to customer churn
- Build a prediction model that will perform the following:

a) Classify whether a customer is going to churn or not\n
b) Obtain churn probability as part of the previous classification, to make it easier for customer service to target 
low-hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn\n

## 2. Data set review
In this section we seek to explore the structure of our data, in order to understand the input space the data set
and to prepare the sets for exploratory and prediction tasks.

The dataset contains data from 10000 customers with 20 features and a label indicating churn named "exited". 
Let's review these features further to identify what attributes will be necessary and what data manipulation needs to be
 carried out before exploratory analysis and prediction modelling. The following features are available:\n
**Customer identification information** (2 features)\n
customer_id - Customer id\n
branch_code - Branch Code for customer account\n
**Demographic information about customers** (7 features)\n
surname - Surname of customer\n
gender - Gender of customer\n
age - Age of customer\n
dependents_no - Number of dependents\n
occupation - Occupation of the customer\n
city - City of customer (anonymized)\n
country - Country of customer \n
**Customer Bank Relationship** (8 features)\n
salary - Estimated customer salary\n
net_worth_level - Net worth of customer (3:Low 2:Medium 1:High)\n
tenure - Years with the bank\n
credit_score - Credit score\n
num_products - Number of products\n
has_cr_card - Indicates whether the client has a credit card\n
is_active - Indicates whether the client is active\n
days_since_last_transaction - No of Days Since Last Credit in Last 1 year\n
**Transactional Information** (3 features)\n
current_balance - Balance as of today\n
current_month_credit - Total Credit Amount current month\n
current_month_debit - Total Debit Amount current month\n
**Label**\n
exited - Whether the customer actually churned (1/0)\n

We can quickly identify some features that should be treated carefully as there is missing data. These include: gender, 
number of dependents, occupation, city and the number of days since last transaction. Some of these may relate to the 
way this data has been acquired or is being stored and could provide valuable feedback to the managers of this database.

The data corresponds to a snapshot at some point in time (e.g. the balance is for a given date). This leads to several 
questions:
- On which date was this dataset generated and how relevant is this date?
- Would it be possible to obtain balances over a period of time as opposed to a single date?
- What does being an active member mean and are there different degrees to it? 
- Could it be better to provide transaction count both in terms of credits and debits to the account instead?
A break down to the products bought into by a customer could provide more information topping listing of product count.
 In this use case example, we proceed to model without context even though typically having context and better 
 understanding of the data extraction process would give better insight and possibly lead to better and contextual 
 results of the modelling process.
